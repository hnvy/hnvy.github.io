So, every time I want to learn about something new, I will create a folder with the name of the project. New entries will appear at the top of the file. Each file will likely have ~30 KB of data to ensure that loading speeds are not affected.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Add <code>E#0XY</code> to <code>LMN.org</code>: This means that a new session entry (<code>E#0XY</code>) has been added (XY = session number) to <code>LMN.org</code>.</li>
<li><code>Edit E#0XY in LMN.org</code>: This means that a new session entry (E#0XY) has been added (XY = session number) to <code>LMN.org</code>.</li>
<li><code>Edit E#0XY in LMN.org</code>: This means that an edit has been made (to E#0XY) in <code>LMN.org</code>.</li>
<li><code>Update LMN.org</code>: This means that I have corrected minor things like typos and so on.</li>
<li>The <code>logs</code> folder contain log entries (which are free-prose writings about anything I've learned). The names of the files in logs will follow this naming convention: <code>PROJECT_#_logs.org</code>. Introductions to each of these files can be found <a href="#introductions">below</a>.</li>
<li>The <code>pearls</code> folder will also contain markdown files with names that correspond to their <code>logs</code> counterparts. The naming convention is the same as before (i.e., a <code>pearls</code> file for <code>PROJECT_1_logs.org</code> will be called <code>PROJECT_1_pearls.org</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Due to the unnecessarily sophisticated nature of this 'blog', good bits of knowledge may get lost in all of the filler content. Here is an <a href="https://hnvy.github.io/blog-1/01_software/01_editors/02_pearls/vim_1_pearls.html">example</a> of a Pearls file.
</p>

<p>
I didn't like the idea that all of the potentially useful pieces of information will end up floating around, everywhere, in the deep sea of knowledge, waiting for a person to take a plunge and discover them. Therefore, I have come up with this new plan. I called it "pearls".
</p>

<p>
Pearls are top-notch pieces of information which I found to be useful. You'll hopefully be one pearl richer when you find one (unless, of course, you already had a better (or the same) pearl stored in your knowledge box).
</p>

<p>
Please keep in mind that these pearls are meant to serve as a beginner-to-advanced cheat sheet rather than an all-in-one guide. My skills will develop over time, and the content covered will progress from basic to intermediate, and eventually (hopefully) advanced. So, keep an eye out!

I am not an experienced programmer (though I hope to be one someday. Just think of all of the unlimited doors which you could open!). I used Notepad++ as my primary text editor while writing programs. I still use it (almost every day), but not for programming.
</p>

<p>
Well, when I used Linux, there were a couple of text editors that came pre-installed, and Vim was one of them. So, I launched it, and I couldn't exit the editor. Therefore, I decided to never touch it again, and hence I've forgotten about it.
</p>

<p>
The other day, I came across a couple of messages online which included pictures of a text editor which had ~ at the start of each line. I instantly remembered where I've seen this before! I also remembered that I still had to tie up some loose ends. So, here I am now.
</p>

<p>
Learning <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> is definitely on my want-to-do list. The only issue is that Emacs is faster on Linux when compared to Windows (I think it's because of the way the editor is built? I read somewhere that it has something to do with the fact that it loads many small files, which can make Windows a little upset). So, in order for me to get the full sweet Emacs experience, I'd have to go back to Linux. However, I have had the pleasure to talk with an eminent Emacs user known as Xah Lee. Xah uses Emacs on Windows and has not noticed any issues with regards to performance.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, I've never been able to pinpoint a specific reason why I should learn Emacs (a reason other than "it looks like a lot of fun" and "it has Org-mode"). So, I stopped bothering my brain with such unimportant thoughts and relied on my learning drive, confident that one day I would be glad I did. At the end of the day, what harm can learning and studying the things you enjoy bring? None that I am aware of!
</p>

<p>
Now that we're done with the introduction, let's get learning!

Here, I will put details on various programming languages that I may learn about. I'll make an effort to keep explanations simple so that anyone from any background can understand what is going on. So, anticipate a lot of waffle.
</p>

<p>
I would like to thank the almighty Emacs for making life so much easier by allowing me to export the current file as HTML. That has truly saved me a lot of time. All I had to do was do M-x htmlfontify-buffer (which I discovered by accident), and ta-daaa!

<h3 id="science">Science</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-science">
<p>
Here I'll discuss various non-computer science topics that I find fascinating. Please do your research after reading the content before memorising it, as there is no assurance that it will be accurate, correct, or up-to-date. If you see an error, or if you want to discuss something, then please let me know. I'll be more than happy to chat about geeky things!
</p>

<p>
I have decided to post my science notes (mainly Medicine-related) online for people to have a look at (particularly other healthcare professionals). They may be inaccurate, and indeed wrong at times. Yet again, I strongly advise that you should ALWAYS refer back to a credible source before commiting this knowledge to memory.
</p>

<p>
The text will be difficult to understand at times, and that is because I don't quite have the time to simplify it. However, I have tried my best to make it super easy to understand (even by a curious 9-year-old)!
</p>

<p>
If a topic is large enough, I may make a separate file that is dedicated to it. The file will most likely be written in stages rather than all at once.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you'll note that I've included some of my own artwork. This is because I believe that science is art and art is science. I'll most likely write about it in the future.

<div id="outline-container-language" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="language">Language</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-language">
<p>
Here I will document my language learning progress. I plan to learn the following languages:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Japanese (I'd like to read a few of my favourite Japanese books in their original language.)</li>
<li>Arabic (I think this has the most complex syntax of any language, and knowing a significant portion of it would be terrific)</li>
<li>Hebrew (I want to read the Bible in Hebrew. Don't ask me why.)</li>
<li>Russian (same as reason as Japanese)</li>
<li>On and off, I've attempted to learn Japanese. I began on the 2nd of July, 2019. When university commenced, though, I had little to no time to devote to language learning, and therefore I put it on pause.</li>
</ul>

<p>
On the 26th of August, 2020, I attempted to restart. The same problem as before has arisen, and I've put it on hold once more.
</p>

<p>
After some thought, I believe the lack of a comprehensive timeline and roadmap was to blame. It was a disaster to not have either of those. It's going to be different this time. Every weekend, I will commit a couple of hours to learning a language. Slowly but steadily, I am improving at this skill. Take a look at the number of <a href="https://hnvy.github.io/blog-1/02_science/01_logs/science_1_logs.html">art pieces</a> I've created, for example (I know it is not much, but at least it is not zero!).
</p>

<p>
I am familiar with the Hebrew and Arabic alphabets, but my grasp of those languages isn't that excellent. I want to increase my vocabulary so that I can achieve my desired goals.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to learning a language, spaced repetition is crucial. Integrating yourself in it is just as, if not more, beneficial. So, these are the only two tool which I will use in order to learn new languages. No paid apps, and certainly no fancy software (well, apart from the great SRS)!
