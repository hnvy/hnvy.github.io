<h1>hnvy.github.io</h1>
<p>This site is for me to document my thoughts, ideas, and progress. It is composed of nothing but HTML and simple CSS. No Javascript, no analytics, no cookies, no advertisement, no nothing. Just text and, sometimes, pictures. Think of it as a personal Wiki page of a young learner rather than a blog...</p>

<h1 id="esotp">Edit Something on this Page (ESoTP)</h1>
<p>This website exists solely to demonstrate that being a novice is perfectly OK, and that novices make mistakes (lots of them). Every page on this site will have a hyperlink, at the top, to allow you to Edit Something on this Page (ESoTP). This is a call to action for you to identify any errors (any errors) in my work, fix them, and send pull requests.</p>
